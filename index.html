  <!-- Paragraph One (Abby) -->
  <p>There once was a bee named Barry. Barry was an ordinary bee in an ordinary hive in the middle of a field in central park New York. Today was the day that he graduated from bee school with a great report card; all Bâ€™s. He got dressed in yellow and black (not black and yellow), put on some honey deodorant and met up with his best friend Adam. Together they flew to the graduation ceremony which was quickly over and turned into a tour of the hive and the various jobs they might choose from. This was the moment Barry realized that he would be forced to pick a job that he would have forever. This was something he could not agree to. </p>
