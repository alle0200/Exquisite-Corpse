         <!-- Paragraph One (Abby) -->
          <p>There once was a bee named Barry. Barry was an ordinary bee in an ordinary hive in the middle of a field in central park New York. Today was the day that he graduated from bee school with a great report card; all B’s. He got dressed in yellow and black (not black and yellow), put on some honey deodorant and met up with his best friend Adam. Together they flew to the graduation ceremony which was quickly over and turned into a tour of the hive and the various jobs they might choose from. This was the moment Barry realized that he would be forced to pick a job that he would have forever. This was something he could not agree to. </p>

        <!-- Paragraph Two (Allie) -->
        <p>One fateful day, Barry witnessed a group of bees returning to the hive. These were no ordinary bees however; they were pollen jocks, some of the bravest bees in the hive. Their job was to venture out into the world and collect pollen for the colony. Determined to see the outside world, and to escape a life of monotony, Barry decided to accompany the pollen jocks on a dangerous scouting mission. Everything seemed to be going according to plan, until Barry got himself stuck to a tennis ball.</p>

        <p>
          The tennis ball went flying at mach speed towards an oncoming tennis racket. Barry saw his life flash before his eyes, and it was really sad. Before Barry's tiny bee brain could even process his existential crisis, his body was smashed to bits between the tennis ball and tennis racket. Miraculously, Barry did survive, but he awoke in the bee hospital with amnesia for bees. Am-bee-sia!

        <!-- Paragraph Four (Anika) -->
        <p>
          Waking up and not remembering anything was terrifying. Barry looked all around the hospital room and all he could see was the IV pumping honey into him. Across the room he saw someone that looked like him. He said his name was Adam Flyman and that we were best friends. “I’m going to avenge you Barry,” he said as he flew out the window headed back to the tennis court. Barry watched him fly away, even more confused than he was before.

        <p>
          Adam was on a mission. Not only would his best friend not remember all of the amazing memories of their school days, but he likely would never fly again. Although grateful that his friend was still alive, he could feel a rage like no other for those responsible. They had to have been humans. He knew that they were dangerous but he had never realized what heartless beasts they really were. Returning to the scene of the crime, Adam began searching for clues–anything that could lead him to the culprit–or as he soon discovered, culprits.

        <!-- Paragraph Six (Allie) -->
        <p>
          The first thing Adam noticed upon returning to the scene of the crime was a long trail of footprints. They were ginormous, and completely covered the field. Adam had heard that humans were large, but he never expected that they would leave behind tracks as massive as these. Even so, he dauntlessly carried on with his investigation. Any fear he might have felt only fueled his rage further. “How dare these humans–no, these heartless, unforgiving monsters–pick on us just because we’re the little guys,” Adam thought to himself. “I will make them pay for their reckless insolence!”

        <!-- Paragraph Seven (Charlie) -->
        <p>
          Adam flies forward with rage filling his tiny bee veins. He spots two humans, a man and a woman, and they are holding judge gavels. Preparing to smash Adam with their gavels, Adam rushes forward and stings the man right in the ass! "Ow! I’m hit! Oh, lordy, I am hit!" screeches the man. The woman runs away like the coward she is, leaving behind her judge gavel. "The venom! The venom is coursing through my veins! I have been felled by a wing-ed beast of destruction." The man continues to obnixously complain. Stripped of his stinger, and most of his guts, Adam lies almost lifeless on the ground. "Oh, Barry," Adam sighs, "this was all for you. I love you". Adam releases his last breath.
